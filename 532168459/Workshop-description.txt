This is a set of QOL improvements I made for my groups co-op play-through.
It includes the following:
1. No "press any key" on load screens anymore. Does it for you when you load 100%.
2. No custom mercenary recruitment profit factor cost.
3. No character respec profit factor cost.
4. Also turns on achievements for modded saves
